* **Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and 2017**

* **Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 SDK and Visual Studio 2017 Extensibility Workload**

### Included

PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio has dependencies on the following third party packages, but you don't need to do anything to use them because they are checked into source control, but if you're planning on contributing to this project, you should probably understand them:

* [log4net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/) - logging abstraction layer. Currently its a checked in binary. Should we switch to a NuGet package?

* [Moq](http://code.google.com/p/moq) - mocking library. This is used in the test project only. Looks like this one has already been included using the NuGet manager.
